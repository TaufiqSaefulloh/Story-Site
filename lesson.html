            <h3>Getting Comfortable With The Uncomfortable</h3>
            <p>At heart, I'm a builder and I love this. Sometimes these are little things like a new blog post or a small communication. other times, they come in the form of extensive programs or products to be shipped company-wide. There's always a bit of anxiety whenever I ship something, and depending on the risk involved with the project, that feeling grows. I can't change it, but all I can do is be prepared.</p>

            <h3>Profile Of All Profiles</h3>
            <p>Over the years, I have mastered many things. I've been working as an independent developer running my own projects. I've never worked as an employee at a startup. I've managed my personal brand online, built side projects and several other business ventures.</p>

            <h3>Curious            </h3>
            <p>It's hard to imagine that it's been five years since I first started writing to you all. I've learned a lot in five years, and my life has also changed quite a bit since then. Thanks for the support, and I hope you have a chance to reflect on the past year — toast to a great 2020 and a new decade. Perhaps the number one reason I started this blog is out of curiosity. I was wondering, would anyone care to listen to what I have to say? Will anyone read it? Has anyone ever signed up for more content? I am curious. Wondering if I create a little corner on the internet where I can talk to other designers and share my journey with them, will anyone come up? Well, you did, and thank you!</p>

            <h3>Everyone Learns</h3>
            <p>Maybe you know this, Maybe not. You're still learning, I'm still learning, your boss is still learning, Educators are still learning - anyway your parents and friends are still learning. Everyone is still learning, and that's okay. Today is today, tomorrow is tomorrow.</p>

            <h3>I'm stressed. Do you?</h3>
            <p>I'm currently juggling a healthy list of projects both in InVision and at home. As a result, I'm stressed. It's also a new year, and it brings pressure with new hopes and goals.</p>
