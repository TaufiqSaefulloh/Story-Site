  <h2>I Help Anyone To Tell more relaxed. The good one. Stories That Empower, Inspire, Build Trust, Convert People To People Of Faith, And Connect With Spirits Of Heroes.</h2>
  <div class="border-btm"></div>
  <p>I don't just tell new listeners. I make sure that every inspirational Story you find is created and shared using the appropriate medium. I make sure that every Story connects, engages, informs, and motivates.</p>
  <p>ow a story is packaged, presented, and placed for consumption is as important as the Story itself. This placement not only ensures it is visible but also ensures that it provides value to the reader as a whole—both internally and externally. Each of these stories and moments of experience must be carefully crafted. They need to be designed with that in mind when meeting them on a trip. They need to be packaged into a solution that best tells their Story— everything has to be purposefully designed. I am a storyteller who can implement my stories in various media that best suit the message to be conveyed.</p>
  <p>Remember, every Story and experience is just one of many in your book. The book has a beginning, a middle, a struggle, and yes, for some, an end. This is a HUGE story full of characters and heroes. Each of these characters has a unique relationship with your book. Some of these characters make it to the end of your book; they thrive, living happily ever after; others don't. However, in many of these scenarios, the time they spend with you and them will help shape it. It will positively impact their future when you engage with them and guide them through their unique challenges or give them more questions than answers. Whatever it is, they are connected to it. YOU become part of them. This is not a relationship built by social media posts, blogs, email communications, or even anything else. This friendship is a relationship built over years—through trust. I am the catalyst to help create that belief.</p>
  <p>The stories and experiences that are created are unique to you, and to each of the characters involved. This story is likely to become part of history. This will be what sets you apart from the rest. Like most people, Your Story is still being written. It evolves, changes, but will live long after YOU, and many of the key characters in it have moved on.
  <br><br>
  Is this the Story you want to tell? If not, I can help rewrite your legacy. If so, I can help strengthen it so more will want to be a part of it. That's what I do.</p>
